This week, I have start exploring `reframe` examples through `podman-docker` and understood how to operate docker including commands, path correction and analysing code line.

Additionally, I have covered introduction to HPC including topics such as communication between a computer/laptop with a HPC via internet/network, and what is HPC.

At the end of the week, I have started exploring `OpenFOAM`, `spack` and motorBike CPU benckmark.
