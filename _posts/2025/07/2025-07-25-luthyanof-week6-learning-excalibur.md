**Introduction**
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This week, I began the process of creating a benchmark to test HPC performance. I used examples such as Hello World, Sombrero, and Stream to better understand how benchmarks are structured and executed.

**Challenges**

I faced some challenges that overlapped with last week's tasks, particularly with the use of Slurm commands for job creation in HPC. However, the Myriad server at UCL uses SGE commands instead, which affected the progress of the project.

Finally, I have learned the details of how a benchmark works, including the relationships and connections between its different files.
