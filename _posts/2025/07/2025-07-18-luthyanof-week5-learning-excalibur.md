**Introduction**
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This week, I began testing communication between my laptop and an HPC system provided by UCL for research and experimentation. I attempted to run example tests from [carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-intro/) to familiarize myself with the commands and control system, while encountering some challenges that will be discussed in the next section.

Additionally, I learned more about selecting the available CPUs and GPUs in the HPC system that will be used for testing.

**Challenges**

I faced some challenges while completing the remaining lessons of the Introduction to HPC training via Carpentries Incubator, particularly with the `s-type` commands used for managing queues, jobs, and runs within the HPC system. Working through the terminal also made me realize the importance of memorizing commands learned in previous weeks.

Finally, learning new commands and seeing how they are applied has been incredibly interesting and eye-opening.
